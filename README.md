# ClosetGenie

ClosetGenie is a React Native + Express + Firebase mobile application that will keep track of the user's clothes and provide outfit recommendations for the entire week.

## Objective

People find it hard to find the perfect outfit every day due to the fast-changing fashion trends, weather conditions, and so many different kinds of clothes to pick from every single day. Our objective with this mobile application is to save the userâ€™s time and effort, and reduce the stress of choosing an outfit every day by providing daily outfits for them to choose from. The user will be able to look their best with our recommendation algorithm, thus improving their confidence. Moreover, the product will provide the user with reminders when their laundry basket is full.
